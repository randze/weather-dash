# My-Weather-Dash
A simple weather dash by me using localstorage, bootstrap, and OpenWeatherAPI.

## How it works
- Input the City you want the check the weather for
- The search is saved in a history list and can be clicked to do a search again
- The search history and last search is saved to LocalStorage for fast reload

## Improvements to be done
- Refactoring code
- Error messages for bad input & failed searches
